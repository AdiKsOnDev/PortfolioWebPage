# üåü Portfolio Website README
This portfolio website is built using the **MERN stack (MongoDB, ExpressJS, ReactJS, NodeJS)** with **RESTful API** to showcase projects, and reviews of people who worked with me. The site is designed to offer a user-friendly experience and easy navigation.

## ‚ú® Features
- **MERN Stack:** Utilizes MongoDB for the database, ExpressJS and NodeJS for the backend, and ReactJS for the frontend.
- **Autonomous Deployment:** Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) is set up using Github Actions to deploy automatically to Heroku upon pushing changes to the main branch.
- **(Under Development) Admin panel:** You can add/remove/edit projects in an Admin Panel, accessible at `/admin` URL

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup Instructions
1. **Clone Repository:** Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. **Install Dependencies:** Run `npm install` in both directories and client folder to install server and client-side dependencies.
3. **Environment Variables:** Set up environment variables for the MongoDB connection string, and any necessary configurations.
4. **Make a build folder:** `cd` into `front-end` directory and run `npm run build`
5. **Start the Server:** Run npm start in the root directory to start the server and the client concurrently.
